# Windesheim semester: Object-Oriented Software Development

For this semester we needed to create a Tinder like application in C# with Microsoft SQL server.

We chose to use MAUI instead of WPF for the crossplatform part and because of how it will be the new standard rather then WPF in the comming years.
